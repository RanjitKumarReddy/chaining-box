# Chaining-Box deployment using Vagrant

This deployment option is intended mainly for testing and development. To start the environment simpy run:

    vagrant up

Just to make sure all VMs are correctly setup, force a reboot on all of them through vagrant:

    vagrant reload

This should only be necessary after running `vagrant up` for the first time.
